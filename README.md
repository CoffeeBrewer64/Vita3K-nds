# Vita3K-DS

A Vita3K port/demake/remake for the Nintendo DS(i).

Yes, of course the DS(i) is an inferior console to the Vita. It only exists for fun and for stretching what the DS(i) can do. Don't expect to actually be able to play games with it!

## Twilight Menu ++ & nds-bootstrap

If you are using TwiLightMenu++ and/or nds-bootstrap, be sure to set "ARM9 CPU speed" to "133mhz (TWL)" for better performance.
